# Social Media Usage and Student Well-Being Analysis with R

## Context and Justification

The increasing use of social media among students has raised concerns regarding its impact on academic performance, mental health, and sleep habits. This project aims to analyze relevant data to identify potential patterns and relationships among these variables, in order to better understand the role that social media plays in student life.

## Objectives 

1. Determine the average time spent on social media by student type.

2. Evaluate the relationship between social media usage and academic performance.

3. Explore indicators of social media addiction and their potential impact on mental health and sleep patterns.

4. Analyze the distribution of social media platform usage based on student gender, age, and country.

## Scope

The study population includes students between 16 and 25 years of age enrolled in high school, undergraduate, or postgraduate programs. The analysis adopts a multinational approach, covering participants from multiple countries, including Bangladesh, India, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea.

Data was collected through an online survey conducted during the first quarter of 2025. The dataset size is flexible and can be adapted to different analytical needs, allowing sample configurations ranging from 100 to 1,000 records.

## Dataset description
The dataset consists of 705 records and 13 variables, including both numerical and categorical data relevant to the analysis of student behavior related to social media usage.
